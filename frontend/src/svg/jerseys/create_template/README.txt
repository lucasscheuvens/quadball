All of the following specifications must be met, otherwise the jersey will be REJECTED:

- the outline of the jersey must remain unchanged
- the viewbox of the template must remain unchanged
- all changes must be made below or within the jersey boundaries, NOT outside
- the filetype (svg) must remain the same
- no bitmap images may be included in the svg file (open the file in a Texteditor afterwards and search for "image")
- please refrain from putting your logo on the jersey since it won't be recognizable anyways
- the SVG must not exceed 80KB in size.
- the center of the jersey must have enough space for the number
- send the result to info@quadball.live including your preferred color for the jersey number as HEX code (sample website: https://html-color-codes.info/webfarben_hexcodes/).
- All above criteria will be checked and you will be notified about the result.
